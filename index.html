    <h3>Coyote Rock</h3>
    <div style="text-align: center"><img src="images/coyote.jpg" alt="Coyote" width="500px" /></div>

    <p>Coyote told the people to look after the land and the fish around what is known now as Pot Hole Lake area.  He came back one day and was not happy how they were taking care of the land and the fish.  He got angry.  He used his paw and swiped at the land.  This made a cliff and the fish could not come through that area anymore.  The people had to travel now to get fish.  The coyote is seen on this cliff watching over the land.

    <p>Ladies in Stone
      There was a group of ladies that were travelling home from the hunting camp.  They had big packs full of dried meat and other dried food on their back.  They also had dogs that had a pack as well.  Coyote came along and he was hungry.  He asked them for some food.  They said, “Go away.  We are bringing this food home for our families to get us through the winter. Go away!”  Coyote, trying to look pitiful and asked again. “I have not eaten in days.  I am hungry.  You have lots of food.  You can spare a little for me.”  The women just continued on.  Coyote got angry!  He looked at the women and said, “You will pay for not sharing your food.”  He glared at them and then turned them into stone. To this day you can see the women with their packs and the dog ahead of them on Highway 5A, close to Kamloops.
